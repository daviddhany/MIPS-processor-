# MIPS-processor-
Here’s the description for your GitHub repository:

This repository contains the source code for a MIPS processor implementation. The project is designed to simulate the behavior of a MIPS processor, supporting fundamental concepts of computer architecture and processor design.

Features
	•	Implementation of core MIPS instruction set, including arithmetic, logical, memory access, and control flow instructions.
	•	Modular structure for ease of understanding and extensibility.
	•	Testbenches included for functional verification.
	•	Suitable for educational and experimental purposes.
